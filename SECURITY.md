# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is actively supported with security fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest  | Yes       |
| Older   | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report security issues privately via one of the following channels:

- **GitHub Private Security Advisory**: Use the
  [Security tab → Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/mrhunsaker/Folge_Accessibility/security/advisories/new)
  form in this repository.
- **Email**: Send details to `github@mail.hunsakerweb.com` with the subject line
  `[Folge_Accessibility SECURITY] <short description>`.

### What to include

A useful report includes:

1. A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
2. Steps to reproduce or a minimal proof-of-concept.
3. The version(s) affected.
4. Any suggested mitigations or patches, if known.

### Response timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Acknowledgement of report | 3 days |
| Initial assessment / triage | 7 days |
| Patch / advisory published | 30 days |

If a fix will take longer than 30 days we will notify you and agree on a
coordinated disclosure date.

## Scope

This project is a **documentation publishing pipeline** that processes guide
exports and generates accessible output formats. The security boundary is:

- **In scope**: vulnerabilities in the Python application code (`src/folge_cli/`),
  dependency chain, configuration handling, and API key management.
- **Out of scope**: vulnerabilities in external tools (Pandoc, Ollama, vision
  model servers), the host operating system, or user-supplied guide data.

## API Key Security

API keys for cloud providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) are stored
in `.env` which is `.gitignore`d. Never commit API keys to the repository.

Best practices:

- Use `.env` for all secrets — never hardcode keys in source files.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already configured).
- Use environment-specific keys for development vs. production.
- Rotate keys regularly.

## Dependency Security

Dependencies are tracked in `pyproject.toml`. To audit the installed
environment for known CVEs run:

```bash
uv run pip-audit
```

## Acknowledgements

We follow the
[GitHub coordinated vulnerability disclosure guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities).
